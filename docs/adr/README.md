# ADR Directory — Architecture Decision Records

This directory collects high-level decisions that shape the Fireball specifications and architecture. Each ADR should be a standalone document with:
- Title
- Status (Draft / Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated)
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale
- Consequences
- Date
- Author

Guidance:
- ADRs are meant to supplement, not replace, inline design notes in the specs.
- Cross-reference relevant ADRs from the affected specification documents.
- Keep ADRs lightweight and focused on a single decision.

Usage:
- When linking from a specification, add a short reference like: ADR: ipc-design.md (Draft)
